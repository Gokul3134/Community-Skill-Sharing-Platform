# Community-Skill-Sharing-Platform


ðŸš€ Excited to announce the completion of my first project during my internship at Travarsa Private Limited under the supervision of Shammi Viren sir! ðŸŽ‰ Introducing Community Skill Sharing Platform - an innovative platform that fosters learning and collaboration by enabling users to share, exchange, and develop skills within a vibrant community. I have used HTML and CSS for its frontend designing, along with the functionalities using JavaScript and most importantly backend part using PHP.

Key Features:

>>Skill Categories: Explore and contribute to diverse skill categories tailored to community interests.
>>Instructor Profiles: Connect with skilled instructors through detailed profiles.
>>Course Enrollment: Easily enroll in skill-sharing sessions and courses designed for all learning levels.
>>Scheduling & Sessions: Manage and schedule skill exchange sessions with built-in tools.
>>Payment Processing: Secure payment gateway for accessing premium courses and services.
>>Assignment Sharing System: Share your assignments with others to foster knowledge sharing.
>>Skill Badges & Achievements: Track your progress and earn badges as you develop new skills.


Built using PHP for backend management, MySQL for reliable data storage, and JavaScript for an engaging user experience.
